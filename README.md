# KnotEditor

Originally written in 199x. One of my first programming projects.

Partially refurbished in July-August 2021.

An app for

* drawing knot diagrams
* converting them to 3d knots
* smoothing the knots
* computing and showing Seifert surfaces
* computing some knot invariants
* etc.

Requirements: Linux, Qt5, OpenGL. Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

For possible improvements list please refer [the TODO](https://github.com/geometer/KnotEditor/blob/master/doc/TODO.md). Please, note: this is not a roadmap. Just a collection of thoughts. Maybe I implement something from the list in the future, maybe not.
