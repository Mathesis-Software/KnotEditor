# KnotEditor
Very-very old code from 199x. One of my first programming projects.

An app for
* drawing knot diagrams
* converting them to 3d knots
* smoothing the knots
* computing and showing Seifert surfaces
* etc.

In July 2021, I found it and made it compilable, installable, and runnable on Ubuntu 20.04 with OpenGL and qt5. Still quite buggy, and I'm not sure I fix it. :)

It even contains some docs (in Russian).
